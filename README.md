SailsJS &amp; AngularJS integration

This is my first attempt to use SailsJS and integrate it with AngularJS.
This is a very small resizable application that loads three tabs loading news from Yahoo News Rss services.

Technologies used:
- Sails.JS
- Angular.JS
- FeedParser

Files modified:
- assets/js/script.js
- assets/styles/style.css
- views/layout.ejs
- views/home/index.ejs
- api/services/RssFeedParserService.js
- api/controllers/HomeController.js
- api/controllers/NewsapiController.js
